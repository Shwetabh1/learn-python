Hi,

Just wanted to touch base with you to provide my updates and also clarify few doubts.

clarification

Are we following PEP8 style guide or anyone else? Have we made some modifications to it?


On AWS front. I am familiar with Lamda. 
I have added my theoretical notes and couple of functions I have done on JS.
My plan is to convert them to Python. If you have any problem statement I would be glad to take up.

Thanks,
Shwetabh Shekhar
