The major syntactical difference

Python Indentations (no brackets)
Indentation is important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

e.g
if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")
Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation.

Comments (# or """)
Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.

Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:

#This is a comment.
print("Hello, World!")
Docstrings

Docstrings can be one line, or multiline. Docstrings are also comments:

Python uses triple quotes at the beginning and end of the docstring:

"""This is a 
multiline docstring."""
print("Hello, World!")


Python is completely object oriented, and not "statically typed".
You do not need to declare variables before using them, or declare
their type. Every variable in Python is an object.
Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for
declaring a variable.
A variable is created the moment you first assign
a value to it.
